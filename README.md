# Real-Time-Tables/FrontEnd

This project aims to create real time time-table for classes. They can be updated according to different conditions. And all this happens in real time.
For example any teacher cancels his/her lecture due to some reasons the real time table can be updated accordingly by any student in the class and the updated time tables changes can be easily viewed by other students in the class.
